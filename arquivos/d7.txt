Trends and Developments Shaping the Future of Diagnostic Medical Imaging: 2015
Annual Oration in Diagnostic Radiology.

Cardiac radiology: centenary review.

During the past century, cardiac imaging technologies have revolutionized the
diagnosis and treatment of acquired and congenital heart disease. Many important 
contributions to the field of cardiac imaging were initially reported in
Radiology. The field developed from the early stages of cardiac imaging,
including the use of coronary x-ray angiography and roentgen kymography, to
nowadays the widely used echocardiographic, nuclear medicine, cardiac computed
tomographic (CT), and magnetic resonance (MR) applications. It is surprising how 
many of these techniques were not recognized for their potential during their
early inception. Some techniques were described in the literature but required
many years to enter the clinical arena and presently continue to expand in terms 
of clinical application. The application of various CT and MR contrast agents for
the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia is a case in point, as the utility of
contrast agents continues to expand the noninvasive characterization of
myocardium. The history of cardiac imaging has included a continuous process of
advances in our understanding of the anatomy and physiology of the cardiovascular
system, along with advances in imaging technology that continue to the present
day.
