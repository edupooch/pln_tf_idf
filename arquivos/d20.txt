RADIOLOGY EDUCATION: A PILOT STUDY TO ASSESS KNOWLEDGE OF MEDICAL STUDENTS
REGARDING IMAGING IN TRAUMA.

BACKGROUND: Trauma remains one of the most frequent presentations in emergency
departments. Imaging has established role in setting of acute trauma with ability
to identify potentially fatal conditions. Adequate knowledge of health
professionals regarding trauma imaging is vital for improved healthcare. In this 
work we try to assess knowledge of medical students regarding imaging in trauma
as well as identify most effective way of imparting radiology education.
METHOD: This cross-sectional pilot study was conducted at Aga Khan University
Medical College & Khyber Girls Medical College, to assess knowledge of medical
students regarding imaging protocols practiced in initial management of trauma
patients.
RESULTS: Only 40 & 20% respectively were able to identify radiographs included in
trauma series. Very few had knowledge of correct indication for Focused abdominal
sonography in trauma. Clinical radiology rotation was reported as best way of
learning radiology.
CONCLUSION: Change in curricula & restructuring of clinical radiology rotation
structure is needed to improve knowledge regarding Trauma imaging.
