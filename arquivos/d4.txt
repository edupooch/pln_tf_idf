Using Twitter for Teaching and Learning in an Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology
Course.

The aim of this study was to describe the implementation of one form of social
media (Twitter) in an oral radiology course and evaluate dental students' use and
perceptions of this technology for teaching and learning. An author-developed
questionnaire was used to solicit second-year students' knowledge, use, and
perceptions of Twitter for teaching and learning in an oral radiology course at
one U.S. dental school. A combination of Likert scales, multiple allowable
answers, and an open-ended comment question was employed. The questionnaire was
piloted in spring 2010 followed by data collection in spring 2011. Out of 45
students, 40 (88.9%) completed the questionnaire. Of the respondents, 95%
reported having not used Twitter prior to their second year of dental school; 55%
of them created an account for the course. The top two reasons they gave for
creating an account were viewing radiographic examples and staying informed about
questions and answers that were posted. The top two reasons they gave for not
creating an account were that the content was viewable online without an account 
and not wanting another online account. The students perceived the Twitter
sessions as helpful and reported it improved accessibility to the instructor. The
results of this study challenged the assumption that dental students are well
versed in all forms of social media, but overall, these students agreed that the 
use of Twitter had enhanced the learning environment in the radiology course.
