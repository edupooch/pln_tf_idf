From the clinical to the managerial domain: the lived experience of role
transition from radiographer to radiology manager in South-East Queensland.


INTRODUCTION: This study seeks to add to current literature a descriptive account
of the lived experience of radiographers' transition to, and experiences of,
management roles and identifies additional resources and support that are
perceived as being beneficial for this transition.
METHODS: This study employed a descriptive phenomenological stance. Using
purposive sampling, six South-East Queensland based private practice radiology
managers, who had held their position for longer than 3 months, participated in
audiotape recorded in-depth interviews exploring their transition to, and
experiences of management in radiology. Thematic analysis was used to describe
and make meaning of the data.
RESULTS: Overall, five central themes emerged through thematic analysis of the
data. The results indicate that all participants' had an underlying drive to
succeed during their role transition and highlight the importance of a
comprehensive orientation by a mentor; the training and support to enable
preparation for the role, especially in the area of people management skills and 
communication; the importance of access to networking opportunities and the
importance of concise expectations from higher management.
CONCLUSION: Role transition can be marred with uncertainty, however; key
suggestions indicate the importance of having support mechanisms in place before,
during and after transitioning to a managerial role.
