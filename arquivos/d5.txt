Feline dental radiography and radiology: A primer.

PRACTICAL RELEVANCE: Information crucial to the diagnosis and treatment of feline
oral diseases can be ascertained using dental radiography and the inclusion of
this technology has been shown to be the best way to improve a dental practice.
Becoming familar with the techniques required for dental radiology and
radiography can, therefore, be greatly beneficial.
CLINICAL CHALLENGES: Novices to dental radiography may need some time to adjust
and become comfortable with the techniques. If using dental radiographic film,
the generally recommended 'E' or 'F' speeds may be frustrating at first, due to
their more specific exposure and image development requirements. Although
interpreting dental radiographs is similar to interpreting a standard bony
radiograph, there are pathologic states that are unique to the oral cavity and
several normal anatomic structures that may mimic pathologic changes. Determining
which teeth have been imaged also requires a firm knowledge of oral anatomy as
well as the architecture of dental films/digital systems.
EVIDENCE BASE: This article draws on a range of dental radiography and radiology 
resources, and the benefit of the author's own experience, to review the basics
of taking and interpreting intraoral dental radiographs. A simplified method for 
positioning the tubehead is explained and classic examples of some common oral
pathologies are provided.
