Radiography Students' Learning: A Literature Review.

PURPOSE: To describe research methodology and findings concerning radiography
students' learning.
METHODS: Health sciences databases were searched to perform a traditional
narrative literature review. Thirty-five peer-reviewed articles published between
2000 and 2014 were analyzed using thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Specific methods of learning were found to be of the most interest. The 
studies focused primarily on the use and usability of a method or the students'
general experiences of it. The most commonly studied methods were e-learning and 
interprofessional learning, which students perceived as positive methods for
theoretical studies and clinical training. Students' learning regarding research 
was the focus of only one article reporting a wide variety of students' research 
interests. Most studies reported quantitative research gathered from
questionnaires and surveys.
CONCLUSIONS: Additional research, especially from a qualitative point of view, is
needed to deepen the evidence-based knowledge of radiography student learning.
