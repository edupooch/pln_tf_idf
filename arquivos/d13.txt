Natural Language Processing in Radiology: A Systematic Review.

Radiological reporting has generated large quantities of digital content within
the electronic health record, which is potentially a valuable source of
information for improving clinical care and supporting research. Although
radiology reports are stored for communication and documentation of diagnostic
imaging, harnessing their potential requires efficient and automated information 
extraction: they exist mainly as free-text clinical narrative, from which it is a
major challenge to obtain structured data. Natural language processing (NLP)
provides techniques that aid the conversion of text into a structured
representation, and thus enables computers to derive meaning from human (ie,
natural language) input. Used on radiology reports, NLP techniques enable
automatic identification and extraction of information. By exploring the various 
purposes for their use, this review examines how radiology benefits from NLP. A
systematic literature search identified 67 relevant publications describing NLP
methods that support practical applications in radiology. This review takes a
close look at the individual studies in terms of tasks (ie, the extracted
information), the NLP methodology and tools used, and their application purpose
and performance results. Additionally, limitations, future challenges, and
requirements for advancing NLP in radiology will be discussed.
