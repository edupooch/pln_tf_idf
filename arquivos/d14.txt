The role of radiology in the evolution of the understanding of articular disease.

Both the clinical practice of radiology and the journal Radiology have had an
enormous effect on our understanding of articular disease. Early descriptions of 
osteoarthritis (OA) appeared in Radiology. More recently, advanced physiologic
magnetic resonance (MR) techniques have furthered our understanding of the early 
prestructural changes in patients with OA. Sodium imaging, delayed
gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging of cartilage, and spin-lattice relaxation in the
rotating frame (or T1ρ) sequences have advanced understanding of the
pathophysiology and pathoanatomy of OA. Many pioneering articles on rheumatoid
arthritis (RA) also have been published in Radiology. In the intervening decades,
our understanding of the natural history of RA has been altered by these
articles. Many of the first descriptions of crystalline arthropathies, including 
gout, calcium pyrophosphate deposition, and hydroxyapatite deposition disease,
appeared in Radiology.
