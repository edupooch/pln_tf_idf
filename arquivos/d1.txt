Awareness of radiation protection and dose levels of imaging procedures among
medical students, radiography students, and radiology residents at an academic
hospital: Results of a comprehensive survey.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the awareness of radiation protection issues and the
knowledge of dose levels of imaging procedures among medical students, radiology 
residents, and radiography students at an academic hospital.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 159 young doctors and students (including 60
radiology residents, 56 medical students, and 43 radiography students) were
issued a questionnaire consisting of 16 multiple choice questions divided into
three separated sections (i.e., demographic data, awareness about radiation
protection issues, and knowledge about radiation dose levels of common
radiological examinations).
RESULTS: Medical students claimed to have at least a good knowledge of radiation 
protection issues more frequently than radiology residents and radiography
students (94.4% vs 55% and 35.7%, respectively; P<0.05), with no cases of
perceived excellent knowledge among radiography students. However, the actual
knowledge of essential radiation protection topics such as regulations, patient
and tissue susceptibility to radiation damage, professional radiation risk and
dose optimisation, as well as of radiation doses delivered by common radiological
procedures was significantly worse among medical students than radiology
residents and radiography students (P<0.05). Those latter significantly
outperformed radiology residents as to knowledge of radiation protection issues
(P<0.01). Overall, less than 50% of survey respondents correctly answered all
questions of the survey.
CONCLUSIONS: Radiology residents, radiography students and medical students have 
a limited awareness about radiation protection, with a specific gap of knowledge 
concerning real radiation doses of daily radiological examinations. Both
undergraduate and postgraduate teaching needs to be effectively implemented with 
radiation safety courses.
