Ebola virus disease: radiology preparedness.

At present, there is a major emphasis on Ebola virus disease (EVD) preparedness
training at medical facilities throughout the United States. Failure to have
proper EVD procedures in place was cited as a major reason for infection of
medical personnel in the United States. Medical imaging does not provide
diagnosis of EVD, but patient assessment in the emergency department and
treatment isolation care unit is likely to require imaging services. The purpose 
of this article is to present an overview of relevant aspects of EVD disease and 
preparedness relevant to the radiologic community.
