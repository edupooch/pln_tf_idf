Public transparency Web sites for radiology practices: prevalence of price,
clinical quality, and service quality information.

PURPOSE: To assess information regarding radiology practices on public
transparency Web sites.
METHODS: Eight Web sites comparing radiology centers' price and quality were
identified. Web site content was assessed.
RESULTS: Six of eight Web sites reported examination prices. Other reported
information included hours of operation (4/8), patient satisfaction (2/8),
American College of Radiology (ACR) accreditation (3/8), on-site radiologists
(2/8), as well as parking, accessibility, waiting area amenities, same/next-day
reports, mammography follow-up rates, examination appropriateness, radiation
dose, fellowship-trained radiologists, and advanced technologies (1/8 each).
CONCLUSION: Transparency Web sites had a preponderance of price (and to a lesser 
extent service quality) information, risking fostering price-based competition at
the expense of clinical quality.
